Here's a step-by-step guide to assist you:</p> <p>First and foremost, gather your tools:</p> <ul> <li>Soldering Iron  </li> <li>Solder  </li> <li>Angle Cutters or Nippers</li> </ul> <p>Begin by placing your badge face up on your worktable.</p> <p>Retrieve all the Blinkie through-hole LEDs from the bag. Make sure you have all 7 of them.</p> <p>Examine the LEDs closely to identify their correct orientation within the badge. Correct placement is crucial.</p> <p>These 5mm through-hole LEDs have two key indicators for proper placement within the badge.</p> <p>The first indicator is the shape of the diode itself. One side of the diode features a flat surface, which signifies the cathode or negative side. Align this side with the silk screen on the badge and insert the LEDs accordingly.</p> <p>The second indicator is the length of the legs. One of the legs is longer than the other, indicating the cathode or negative side (the shorter leg).</p> <p></p> <p>Now that you've identified the correct orientation of the LEDs, carefully insert them into the badge. Ensure that the cathode side (shorter leg or flat side) aligns with the corresponding label on the back of the badge (facing downward). Insert each LED from the front so that they are visible on the badge's front side.</p> <p>To prevent the LEDs from falling out, consider bending their legs slightly after insertion.</p> <p></p> <p>Once all LEDs are correctly placed and positioned, perform a quick check. If they're properly connected, they should illuminate when you turn on the badge.</p> <p>It's time to fire up your soldering iron. Carefully solder the back of each LED's leg using your soldering tool and trim any excess leg length.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"bg/badge1/","title":"build guide for badge 1","text":""},{"location":"bg/badge2/","title":"build guide for badge 2","text":""},{"location":"faq/","title":"FAQ Page","text":""},{"location":"misc/misc1/","title":"Misc Documentation","text":""}]}
